## What is Context Engineering?

Context engineering is the discipline of managing the language model's context window. Unlike prompt engineering, which focuses on crafting effective instructions, context engineering addresses the holistic curation of all information that enters the model's limited attention budget: system prompts, tool definitions, retrieved documents, message history, and tool outputs.

The fundamental challenge is that context windows are constrained not by raw token capacity but by attention mechanics. As context length increases, models exhibit predictable degradation patterns: the "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon, U-shaped attention curves, and attention scarcity. Effective context engineering means finding the smallest possible set of high-signal tokens that maximize the likelihood of desired outcomes.

## Recognition

This repository is cited in academic research as foundational work on static skill architecture:

> "While static skills are well-recognized [Anthropic, 2025b; Muratcan Koylan, 2025], MCE is among the first to dynamically evolve them, bridging manual skill engineering and autonomous self-improvement."

## Design Philosophy

### Progressive Disclosure

Each skill is structured for efficient context use. At startup, agents load only skill names and descriptions. Full content loads only when a skill is activated for relevant tasks.

### Platform Agnosticism

These skills focus on transferable principles rather than vendor-specific implementations. The patterns work across Claude Code, Cursor, and any agent platform that supports skills or allows custom instructions.

### Conceptual Foundation with Practical Examples

Scripts and examples demonstrate concepts using Python pseudocode that works across environments without requiring specific dependency installations.

### For Cursor (Open Plugins)

This repository is listed on the [Cursor Plugin Directory](https://cursor.directory/plugins/context-engineering).

The `.plugin/plugin.json` manifest follows the [Open Plugins](https://open-plugins.com) standard, so the repo also works with any conformant agent tool (Codex, GitHub Copilot, etc.).

### Using Individual Skills

To use a single skill without installing the full plugin, copy its `SKILL.md` directly into your project's `.claude/skills/` directory:

```bash
# Example: add just the context-fundamentals skill
mkdir -p .claude/skills
curl -o .claude/skills/context-fundamentals.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muratcankoylan/Agent-Skills-for-Context-Engineering/main/skills/context-fundamentals/SKILL.md
```

Available skills: `context-fundamentals`, `context-degradation`, `context-compression`, `context-optimization`, `latent-briefing`, `multi-agent-patterns`, `memory-systems`, `tool-design`, `filesystem-context`, `hosted-agents`, `evaluation`, `advanced-evaluation`, `harness-engineering`, `project-development`, `bdi-mental-states`

### For Custom Implementations

Extract the principles and patterns from any skill and implement them in your agent framework. The skills are deliberately platform-agnostic.

## Researcher Operating System

The [researcher](researcher/) directory is a file-based operating system for turning external research into skill changes. It exists so this repository can act as a compounding source of truth instead of an anthology.

### Measured router-benchmark results

The skill router (which decides whether the right skill gets loaded for a given task) has been benchmarked end-to-end against four frontier models via the [Cursor SDK](https://cursor.com/docs/sdk/typescript). Three full sweeps (50 prompts x 4 models x 3 replications = 600 calls each):

- Baseline: [`researcher/benchmarks/router/results-published/2026-05-15.md`](researcher/benchmarks/router/results-published/2026-05-15.md)
- After targeted description rewrites: [`researcher/benchmarks/router/results-published/2026-05-15-v2.md`](researcher/benchmarks/router/results-published/2026-05-15-v2.md) (includes delta-vs-baseline)
- After corpus-wide hardening: [`researcher/benchmarks/router/results-published/2026-05-19.md`](researcher/benchmarks/router/results-published/2026-05-19.md) (600/600 usable records, 0 format failures)

Per-skill effect size for the three skills the data flagged:

| Skill | Baseline top-1 | After rewrite | Delta |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `context-fundamentals` | 0.255 | 0.489 | +23.4pp |
| `project-development` | 0.750 | 1.000 | +25pp (now perfect) |
| `tool-design` | 0.729 | 0.807 | +7.8pp |

Per-model top-1 accuracy after the corpus-wide hardening pass:

| Model | Top-1 | Top-3 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| gemini-3.1-pro | 0.920 | 0.933 |
| composer-2 | 0.913 | 0.947 |
| gpt-5.5 | 0.913 | 0.973 |
| claude-opus-4-7 | 0.840 | 0.933 |

Reproduce any of these numbers exactly via the runner under `researcher/benchmarks/sdk-runner/`.

### What it includes

- **Source registry** (`researcher/source-registry.md`): priority sources, exclusion rules, monitoring queries.
- **Rubrics** (`researcher/rubrics/`): content curation, skill change, harness change, pairwise skill revision.
- **Mechanism registry** (`researcher/mechanisms/registry.jsonl` + `ledgers/`): 16 accepted behavior changes used as the primary novelty signal, with append-only accepted/rejected ledgers for institutional memory.
- **Claim provenance** (`researcher/claims/index.jsonl`): 12 provenance-tracked claims with source URL, evidence strength, volatility, and last reviewed date.
- **Corpus index** (`researcher/corpus/index.json`): canonical machine-readable map of skills, activation scenarios, mechanism IDs, and claim IDs.
- **Run state machine** (`researcher/runs/<run-id>/run-state.json`): `initialized -> retrieved -> evaluated -> proposed -> novelty_checked -> validated -> pr_ready -> closed`.
- **Activation regression tests** (`researcher/fixtures/activation-cases.jsonl`): 19 deterministic prompts that catch skill-boundary confusion.
- **Adversarial benchmark harness** (`researcher/benchmarks/`): scenarios that try to game the loop (duplicate mechanisms, unretrieved evidence, wrong rubric math, self-approved rubric changes, weak-evidence novelty).
- **Continuous loop** (`researcher/scripts/loop_*.py` + `researcher/orchestration/launchd/`): inbox, source discovery, one-state-at-a-time advancement, daily ops, parked review queue, launchd service definitions.
- **Skill health gate** (`researcher/scripts/skill_health.py`): deterministic body-quality scoring; current strict corpus score is 0.9117 with 0 flagged skills.

### Operator commands

```bash
# Deterministic gates (also run in CI on every PR)
python3 researcher/scripts/validate_repo.py --strict
python3 researcher/scripts/skill_health.py --strict --no-history
python3 researcher/scripts/run_benchmarks.py
python3 researcher/scripts/check_activation_cases.py

# Per-run readiness (active runs only)
python3 researcher/scripts/validate_run.py --run-dir researcher/runs/<run-id>

# Continuous loop, manual
python3 researcher/scripts/loop_discover.py
python3 researcher/scripts/loop_step.py --allow-fetch
python3 researcher/scripts/loop_daily.py
python3 researcher/scripts/loop_status.py

# Continuous loop, daemon (macOS)
researcher/orchestration/launchd/install.sh    # install launchd jobs (10-min step, 12h discover, daily ops)
researcher/orchestration/launchd/uninstall.sh  # remove launchd jobs
```

See [researcher/runbooks/continuous-operation.md](researcher/runbooks/continuous-operation.md) for daemon details, budgets, and the human review surface.

### Guarantees

- The loop never invokes paid LLMs or makes outbound writes; HTTP retrieval is stdlib-only with a 1.5 MB cap and a 30-second timeout.
- Mechanism promotion requires a recorded human reviewer and a passing run-readiness check.
- All queue mutations are atomic (temp file + `os.replace`) and serialized via `fcntl` locks.
- Agents may prepare PRs after gates pass; merge and push remain human-controlled.
